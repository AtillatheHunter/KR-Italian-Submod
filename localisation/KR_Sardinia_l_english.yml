SRD_end_resistance:0 "End Resistance"

If we are ever to retake our beloved Savoia and resume our rightful leadership over Italy, in any sort of form, we have to root out problem bureaucrats, nepotistic laws, and antiquated systems."
SRD_new_constitution:0 "New Constitution"
SRD_new_constitution_desc:0 "Our Rule over the Kingdom of Italy has been undemocratic and backed with unspoken pledges and hidden loyalties.

SRD_freedom_of_speech:0 "Worker's Rights"
SRD_freedom_of_speech_desc:0 "Now that we are moving swiftly, and mostly smoothly into a more free and open society, we need to make sure that the government guarantees rights of workers.

The people of Sicilia have always been a poorer lot than our lands in the North, and we must protect even the weakest of our populace. It is our social responsibility to our brethren."
SRD_industrial_grants:0 "Industrial Grants"
SRD_industrial_grants_desc:0 "To kickstart the Sicilian industry we must inject it with subsidies and outfit it with the bleeding edge of technology. Our efforts will be worth the trouble."

SRD_sl_won_desc:0 "The Lega Democratica Reale have claimed victory in the election and have formed a liberal coalition government."

SRD_strengthen_democracy:0 "Strengthen Democracy"
SRD_strengthen_democracy_desc:0 "We need to ensure that even in small mountainous towns in the center of our Kingdom people know the rule of law, and the people's decisions elect and empower those in charge. Every political office from Prime Minister down to dog catcher needs to be an elected position, and cannot have terms that are so long as to ignore the will of the people."
SRD_free_press:0 "Free Press"
SRD_free_press_desc:0 "One of the greatest stimuluses in western culture is the movement of free press. We must also ensure free press to our people, and the right to share ideas and news freely, regardless of politics. Free press, after all, is a necessary part of a truly democratic society."

SRD_catholic_social_teaching:0 "Catholic Social Unions"
SRD_catholic_social_teaching_desc:0 "We are a country united not by language or culture, but by faith. It is faith in God alone that can bind our people together. Let us strengthen our communion with the Lord."

We must not let them forget of the unholy Syndicalists in the north and remind them of our needs."
SRD_protectionism:0 "Protect our Markets"
SRD_protectionism_desc:0 "We must protect our markets from foreign exploitation. Through tariff if necessary."
SRD_constitutional_monarchy:0 "Constitutional Monarchy"
SRD_constitutional_monarchy_desc:0 "We need to adjust our laws to accomodate the fact that we still have a royal family, but the people make the majority of the decisions.

SRD_organic_kingdom:0 "Integralisti Victory"
SRD_organic_kingdom_desc:0 "In a shocking upset, the monarchist and reactionaries have joined forces and won the election. We cannot be sure what the Integralisti have in store for our Kingdom."

SRD_national_catholicism_desc:0 "The people of Sicily are not bound by shallow ideas of Race or delusions of superiority, but by a shared faith. Catholicism is a natural, organic part of our Kingdom.

SRD_disolve_parliament: "Suspend Parliament"
SRD_disolve_parliament_desc:0 "As long as there are enemies within and outside of our government we cannot afford to be bogged down by bureaucracy, as even during the Alleanza Monarchica's tenure the King had several roadblocks. We must suspend parliament until a later date."
SRD_secret_police:0 "OVRA"
SRD_secret_police_desc:0 "General Starace has managed to obtain enough intel to find potential instigators and suggests we set up a network of secret police he has referred to as the OVRA, or Organization for Vigilance and Repression of Anti-Monarchism. He ensures his men can have them thoroughly removed and if we are pleased, we can continue the program. We like this idea."
SRD_organic_legal_code:0 "New Legal Code"
SRD_organic_legal_code_desc:0 "The laws for a Nation should not cater for the individualist needs of the Few, but rather to every subject of the Kingdom, for each to diligently aid the realm and improve itself in peace and prosperity."
SRD_loyal_officers:0 "Loyal Officers"
SRD_loyal_officers_desc:0 "Though our government won out in the elections, the Carabinieri still has many officers with republican sympathies. General Starace has suggested a few less-than-savory methods of ensuring their continued loyalty, but given little option we must approve."
SRD_restore_nobility:0 "Protect the Noble Class"
SRD_restore_nobility_desc:0 "Much of the Italian aristocracy and land holding elite have very little power. The Magna Curia has decided that we must protect the aristocratic class and ensure their rights."
SRD_propaganda:0 "Propaganda Efforts"
SRD_propaganda_desc:0 "It is not enough to win the election, as we are constantly fighting to win the hearts and minds of the Italian populace. Amedeo, Duke of Aosta, has suggested a propaganda campaign and building a cult of personality around our cherished Sovereign."

SRD_royal_academy:0 "Reale Accademia"
SRD_royal_academy_desc:0 "The great minds of our nation should not be relying on luck to ensure that they get the funding they need; the King knows better than to let potential breakthroughs go to waste"
SRD_homecoming:0 "Home-Coming"
SRD_homecoming_desc:0 "We have worked out the issues with our government, and made sure to have popular support as well. The Syndicalist menace must be ended, and the crimson tide must be pushed back. We must remind the people of Italy that we won't allow the Socialists to hold the North forever. Instead, we need to make a victorious march all the way to the Alps!"
### Focus - Unification ###
SRD_unification:0 "Begin Risorgimento"
SRD_unification_desc:0 "Now is the time to remind the world from Berlin to Beijing that we won't be at the beck and call of foreign powers, nor shall we stay a fragmented people to be exploited and dominated. Even if by force, we shall re-unite the people of Italy!"
SRD_fortress_sardinia:0 "Fortify the Mezzogiorno"

SRD_military_training:0 "Canadian Military Officers"
SRD_military_training_desc:0 "With the true ruler of Britian residing in Canada for the time being, we should look to our erstwhile allies across the Atlantic for military training.

SRD_destroy_sri:0 "Destroy the Socialist Republic"
SRD_destroy_sri_desc:0 "It's time. We need to return to the north, destroy the socialists who forced us into exile, and liberate the lands of Piedmont.

SRD_kingdom_of_italy:0 "Avanti Savoia!"
SRD_kingdom_of_italy_desc:0 "With the northern Italia under our control once more, we must assert our hegemony by declaring our legitimacy to the world. Our enemies will know that the Savoyards are back in power!"
SRD_destroy_roi:0 "The Milan Affair"
SRD_destroy_roi_desc:0 "The Italian Republic propped up by their Austrian backers in northern Italy is a threat to our goal of absolute restoration. We must see them rejoin us, either through a Plebiscite or through war."
SRD_destroy_two_sicilies:0 "Strike at the False Kingdom"
SRD_destroy_two_sicilies_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Two Sicilies ceased to exist in 1860 after an invasion by the Glorious Hero Giuseppe Garibaldi. It appears these pretenders need to be reminded of this event."
SRD_italian_irredentism:0 "Italian Irrendentism"
SRD_italian_irredentism_desc:0 "We may be close to reuniting Italy, but Italian lands are still in the hands of foreigners. The lands in their mountainous ares of Tyrol, and coastal areas in the eastern Adriatic remain outside of our grasp.

### Focus - economy ###
SRD_industry:0 "Assess the Economy"
SRD_industry_desc:0 "We assumed our tenure in the South would be temporary, less than a year, but a year turned into two, and two turned into five, and five turned into ten... it's time to assess our economy and figure out how to best optimise the little we have remaining. We're going to need all the resources and power the South can provide if we are ever to get back to the North ourselves!"
SRD_export_focus:0 "Revitalizing our Exports"
SRD_export_focus_desc:0 "Italy was once the center of many great merchant republics and the center of European trade. All shipments flowed through the Mediterranean and the Mediterranean was our pond. To ensure that we can reclaim our lost heritage, we will need to ensure that we have a strong merchant fleet."
SRD_industrial_investment:0 "Invest in the Industries"
SRD_industrial_investment_desc:0 "We must strengthen the cogs of our industry to ensure we can produce enough to meet the demands of our trade partners. Calabria had a flourishing industry before the Weltkrieg, perhaps we will start there."
SRD_Italian_vineyards:0 "Italian Vineyards"
SRD_Italian_vineyards_desc:0 "Italy was an important place for fine wine. Our vineyards were the envy of the world. We should invest in these vineyards - one of the prides of our country!"
SRD_Farming_Grants:0 "Farming Grants"
SRD_Farming_Grants_desc:0 "The Southern provinces of Italy have never been fans of rule under the Monarchy and are reluctant to lend their support.

SRD_patronize_the_arts:0 "Patronize the Arts"
SRD_patronize_the_arts_desc:0 "Tourism was a major industry in Italy before the Weltkrieg tore us asunder. We can reclaim this by patronizing the arts. We shall harken back to the days of the Rennaissance!"
SRD_new_economy:0 "New Economy"
SRD_new_economy_desc:0 "Clearly we cannot rely on a German economic hegemony to prop up our economy. We have to be more self-sufficient, and target a few profitable and popular exports to re-orient our economy. When this is finished, Black Monday should be no more than a poor memory, and Italywill be able to move forward into a better, richer future."
SRD_four_year_plan:0 "Four Year Plan"
SRD_four_year_plan_desc:0 "Amedeo di Aosta and Pietro Lanza di Scalea have come before Parliament with their blueprints for what they call a Four Year Plan. The plan is based upon Market Protections, land reform, and revitalizing efforts to force the Mezzogiorno to industrialize. The various politicians, however, disagree on the directions to take. With Parliament at a deadlock, we must choose carefully."
SRD_Revive_the_Mezzogiorno:0 "Industrialize the Mezzogiorno"
SRD_Revive_the_Mezzogiorno_desc:0 "The South was left rural while our original rule saw the industrialization and modernization of the North. The Syndicalists and Republicans are reaping the fruits of our efforts and we have been left with only our mistakes. The Duke of Aosta insists that we can still make this land work for us. Let us begin the process of industrializing."
SRD_Dig_Deep:0 "Dig Deep"
SRD_Dig_Deep_desc:0 "Southern Italy is rich with precious minerals and Sardinia has steel mines that must be explored. To revitalize our industry we will need the metaphorical clay for our base."
SRD_Seize_assets:0 "Seize Assets"
SRD_Seize_assets_desc:0 "The Italia First party, the Integralist Party, argue that we must focus all of our efforts on reuniting the peninsula. To this end we must make the Sicilians cooperate - by force, if necessary."
SRD_Sell_bonds:0 "Sell Bonds"
SRD_Sell_bonds_desc:0 "Most of Parliament sees the best way to mobilize the populace is through selling war bonds. These bonds will allow the Sicilian citizenry to invest in our military and receive a payout after we win."
SRD_farm_privatisation:0 "Land Reform"
SRD_farm_privatisation_desc:0 "If we are to ever gain the trust of the populace, we must engage in land reform. We can redistribute our government held lands as the liberal wing prefers or we can sell the land as our rightists would prefer."
SRD_land_development:0 "Develop the Land"
SRD_land_development_desc:0 "No matter which path we take it is generally agreed that we should develop our lands. As the Two Sicilies is relatively underutilized, parliament has made plans to begin forming a new industrial center."
SRD_distribute_land:0 "Distribute Land"
SRD_distribute_land_desc:0 "The King has decreed the Agrarian Redistribution Act, signing the first of several land reforms into law, and to the cheers of the Mezzogiorno!"
SRD_sell_land:0 "To the Highest Bidder!"
SRD_sell_land_desc:0 "The King has authorized the first Grand Auction, promising to sell off lands to enterprising companies. While this is not a popular maneuver, Market liberals believe it will be enough to help alleviate the worst of Black Monday."
SRD_new_economy:0 "Revitalized Economy"
SRD_new_economy_desc:0 "We have successfully revitalized our economy enough to ensure that Black Friday has ended. While there is still more reform to come, we can breathe a sigh of relief as our economy has began to stabilize. "
SRD_university:0 "Expand the University of Caligari"
SRD_university_desc:0 "Cagliagri University was a shining establishment within the former kingdom, we shall now expand it to meet our research needs."
SRD_economic_miracle:0 "Economic Miracle"
SRD_economic_miracle_desc:0 "Through our economic reforms and the industrial development of the Mezzogiorno, we have crafted an economy that is both more productive, and less reliant on foreign goods.

SRD_superior_fire_power_plan:0 "Superior Firepower"
SRD_superior_fire_power_plan_desc:0 "Sicily may not have a lot of men, but what we can have is every man firing a gun. The more we can concentrate firepower onto an area of the battlefield, the more we can overwhelm our foes with ordinance and artillery, the less they will be able to react. What better way to greet our enemies on the Abruzzo line, but with a wall of explosive lead?"
SRD_elite_army:0 "An Elite Army"
SRD_elite_army_desc:0 "We don't have many men, but what we do have is an abundance of time, and a vast will to be better than our myriad array of enemies. Let us develop special forces for fighting in the mountains, dropping out of the air onto our enemies, and invading them from the sea, and let them be more numerous than our enemies."
SRD_carabinieri:0 "The Carabinieri"
SRD_carabinieri_desc:0 "Our Carabinieri have always been a central part of our armed forces, and an integral part of the first unification of Italy. Let's develop and expand this ancient police force, starting on the island of it's birth. For if we are to re-unite Italy, we will need the police force to help pacify and police it."
SRD_artillery_effort:0 "Artillery Effort"
SRD_artillery_effort_desc:0 "For decades our divisions have been saddled with the antiquated Model 16 howitzer, in part because of its coastal defence use in the 1920s. This situation must be rectified sooner rather than later and new artillery developed."
SRD_arditi:0 "The Arditi"
SRD_arditi_desc:0 "We were among the first countries in the Weltkrieg to learn that slow rolling firepower did nothing to armed men in trenches. Instead our shock troops became a model imitated by other countries. We need to use our background in assault forces to make shock troops to invade the north! "
SRD_arma_del_genio:0 "Arma Del Genio"
SRD_arma_del_genio_desc:0 "Italy has always had a long history of brilliant army engineers. In the Weltkrieg this was expanded to include medical personal and electronic operators. We need new technology so our medics, support technicians, and especially army engineers can excel in this new age of warfare."
SRD_grand_battle_plan:0 "Grand Battle Plan"
SRD_grand_battle_plan_desc:0 "We may not have a lot of men, but a lot of men aren't needed when you can use planning to pick your battles. We need a force with high morale, with tools necessary to dig in, and with officers who can properly assess and make use of the terrain, the weather, and his men."

SRD_bersaglieri_desc:0 "Let us augment our infantry divisions with battalions of our finest Bersaglieri. Their speed and finesse is an important contribution to our military doctrine, as even without vehicles our infantry will not be passed by anyone!

SRD_infantry_tank:0 "Infantry Tanks"
SRD_infantry_tank_desc:0 "Doctrines have evolved since the first Weltkrieg, and more and more nations are incorporating the impressive power of armored units.

SRD_carrier_plan:0 "Iachino's Plan"

SRD_expand_dockyards:0 "Expand the Dockyards"
SRD_expand_dockyards_desc:0 "The Dockyards of Cagliari must be expanded if are to ever build our own vessels once more.

SRD_sardinian_merchant_navy:0 "Merchant Marine"
SRD_sardinian_merchant_navy_desc:0 "With our new dockyards built and ready for orders, the time is ripe for building a new merchant fleet.

SRD_battleships:0 "Battleships"
SRD_battleships_desc:0 "Now that the basics of our new fleet have been worked out, it is time to design some truly great battleships to augment our existing fleet, the first of which shall be our new mighty flagship.

SRD_carriers:0 "Carriers"
SRD_carriers_desc:0 "As our air fleet expands, and more importantly as our planes expand, they will need every larger places to take off and land.

SRD_naval_aviation:0 "Fleet of the Skies"
SRD_naval_aviation_desc:0 "We must not ignore the simple fact that we are an island surrounded by the azure Mediterranean Sea. A fleet of powerful naval bombers would allow us to strike at foreign fleets and docks, and help us permanently dominate Mare Nostrum."

srd.0.t:0 "The Kingdom of Italy"
srd.0.d:0 "The Kingdom of Italy was crushed following the disastorous campaign against the Austrians during the Welt-krieg. While originally only forfeiting territory east of the Po, everything changed when civil war erupted on the peninsula, and at present Piedmont, Aosta, Tuscany, and other lands belonging to the House of Savoy have been held by the Socialist Republic of Italy for well over a decade.\n\nThis sombre state of affairs is made no better by internal divisions at home. King Vittorio Emmanuele III, rules as an absolute monarch; upsetting many, who feel that constitutional monarchy is the only path to progress. This fundamental question, between absolutism and constituionalism, has divided the south since the end of the Weltkrieg, and there is little doubt that the current arrangement is simply untenable. Corruption runs rampant and the judiciary and government both require reform, problems without solutions under the current political deadlock, and without which Italy will never be able to take but what is rightfully hers."
